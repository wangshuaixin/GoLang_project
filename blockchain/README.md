Blockchain from scratch
---

## Introduction

Blockchain is one of the most revolutionary technology in the world. It originated from the famous digital currency Bitcoin. The first distributed blockchain was then conceptualised by an anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and implemented the following year as core component of the digital currency. Essentially, the blockchain is just a distributed recording ledger database. Distinct from other databse is blockchain can not be private. once you use the blockchain, it will public your usage information to the whole chain. And the most important is that the follow-up participant must aggre with all the participant who joined before in this blockchain. That feature made cryptography and smart contract possible.
